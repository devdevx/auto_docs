Amazon SageMaker Clarify generates partial dependence plots (PDPs) to display the marginal effect of features on a machine learning model's predicted outcome. These plots help explain the target response with specific input features. Clarify also extends explainability to both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) by utilizing the same Shapley values (SHAP) algorithm that is used for explaining tabular data models.</p>"},{"location":"cloud/aws/cert-ia-prac/#sagemaker-inference-options","title":"SageMaker inference options","text":"<ul> <li>Real-time Inference: Use for low-latency workloads with predictable traffic patterns that need consistent latency characteristics and are always available.</li> <li>Serverless Inference: Ideal for synchronous workloads with spiky traffic patterns that can tolerate latency variations.</li> <li>Batch Inference: Choose for processing large sets of data offline without requiring a persistent endpoint.</li> <li>Asynchronous Inference: Typically used for asynchronous processing where latency is less critical.

This network topology simplifies network management and minimizes the number of connections that you need to set up and manage. It is implemented virtually and does not require any physical network equipment or a physical presence in a co-location transit hub.</li> <li>AWS PrivateLink gives on-premises networks private access to AWS services through Direct Connect. You can also make services available to other accounts and VPCs that are accessed securely as private endpoints.

From the perspective of the service provider application, all IP traffic will originate from the Network Load Balancer. All IP addresses logged by the application will be the private IP addresses of the Network Load Balancer. The service provider application will never see the IP addresses of the customer or service consumer.</li> <li>You can activate Proxy Protocol v2 to gain insight into the network traffic. Network Load Balancers use Proxy Protocol v2 to send additional connection information such as the source and destination. This might require changes to the application.</li> <li>Endpoint services cannot be tagged.</li> <li>The private Domain Name System (DNS) of the endpoint does not resolve outside of the VPC.

AWS customers often use a VPN or AWS Direct Connect connection to leverage existing corporate proxy server infrastructure, or build a forward proxy farm on AWS using software such as Squid proxy servers with internal Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). You can limit outbound web connections from your VPC to the internet, using a web proxy (such as a squid server) with custom domain whitelists or DNS content filtering services. The solution is scalable, highly available, and deploys in a fully automated way.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cloud/azure/azure/","title":"Azure","text":""},{"location":"cloud/azure/azure/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>AZ-305 exam preparation</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/","title":"Upsert example","text":"<pre><code>{\n    \"_id\": 1,\n    \"sensor\": 5,\n    \"date\": Date(\"2020-10-10\"),\n    \"valcount\": 2,\n    \"total\": 80,\n    \"readings\": [\n        {\"v\": 50, \"t\": 23},\n        {\"v\": 30, \"t\": 24}\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>db.iot.updateOne(\n    {\n        \"sensor\": 5,\n        \"date\": var.date,\n        \"valcount\": { $lt : 48 }\n    },\n    {\n        \"$push\": { \"readings\": {\"v\": var.v, \"t\", var.t}},\n        \"$inc\": {\"valcount\": 1, \"total\": var.v}\n    },\n    { upsert: true}\n)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#workload-description","title":"Workload description","text":"<ul> <li>Query (Anomalies in inventory)</li> <li>Quantification (X/day Y/sec)</li> <li>Qualification (&lt;1s, slate data is fine, critical write)</li> </ul> <p>Details of critical operations</p> <ul> <li>Description</li> <li>Type (R/W)</li> <li>Frequency</li> <li>Size</li> <li>Consistency</li> <li>Latency</li> <li>Durability</li> <li>Life/Duration</li> <li>Security</li> </ul>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#schema-design-patterns","title":"Schema design patterns","text":""},{"location":"databases/mongo/#computed-pattern","title":"Computed pattern","text":"<p>Sum all views of all screenings of movie into movie document</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#bucket-pattern","title":"Bucket pattern","text":"<p>Used in IoT</p> <p>One document per device per day/week</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#extended-reference","title":"Extended reference","text":"<p>Copy required fields from one element to the other (example shipping address)</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#change-streams","title":"Change streams","text":""},{"location":"databases/mongo/#indexes","title":"Indexes","text":"<p>Order fields by equally, sort, range</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#patterns","title":"Patterns","text":""},{"location":"databases/mongo/#attribute-pattern-polymorphic-pattern","title":"Attribute pattern / Polymorphic pattern","text":"<p>Move all diferent attributes but similar and want to search on multiple to a spec array of key-value objects, then create a index on that key-value pair</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#extended-reference-pattern","title":"Extended reference pattern","text":"<p>Copy required fields from one element to the other (example shipping address)</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#subset-pattern","title":"Subset pattern","text":"<p>Move some fields or part of that fields (list, keep top x) to other documents</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#computed-pattern_1","title":"Computed pattern","text":"<p>Sum all views of all screenings of movie into movie document</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#bucket-pattern_1","title":"Bucket pattern","text":"<p>One document per device per day/hour with all readings (upser use case)</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#schema-version-pattern","title":"Schema version pattern","text":"<p>Add version to documents and modify application with multiple handlers while migrations run in batch on background task</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#tree-pattern","title":"Tree pattern","text":"<ul> <li>Parent references</li> <li>Ancestors of X is COMPLEX</li> <li>Reports to Y is SIMPLE</li> <li>All nodes under Z is COMPLEX</li> <li>Change all under N to under P is SIMPLE</li> <li>Child references</li> <li>Ancestors of X is COMPLEX</li> <li>Reports to Y is COMPLEX</li> <li>All nodes under Z is SIMPLE</li> <li>Change all under N to under P is COMPLEX</li> <li>Array of ancestors</li> <li>Ancestors of X is SIMPLE</li> <li>Reports to Y is SIMPLE</li> <li>All nodes under Z is COMPLEX</li> <li> <p>Change all under N to under P is COMPLEX</p> </li> <li> <p>Materialized paths</p> </li> <li>Ancestors of X is SIMPLE</li> <li>Reports to Y is COMPLEX</li> <li>All nodes under Z is COMPLEX</li> <li>Change all under N to under P is COMPLEX</li> </ul> <p>Recomended: Array of ancestors + Parent</p>"},{"location":"databases/mongo/#polymorphic-pattern","title":"Polymorphic pattern","text":"<p>Used in single view cases (join data from different sources).

A NoSchedule taint affects all pods asking the scheduler to block all pods from being scheduled there.\n\nA node selector is useful when the pod needs something from the node. For example, requesting a node that has a GPU. A node taint is useful when the node needs to be reserved for special workloads. For example, a node that should only be running pods that will use the GPU (so the GPU node isn't filled with pods that aren't using it).\n\nSometimes they are useful together as in the example above, too. You want the node to only have pods that use the GPU, and you want the pod that needs a GPU to be scheduled to a GPU node. In that case you may want to taint the node with dedicated=gpu:NoSchedule and add both a taint toleration and node selector to the pod template.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"devops/containers/kubernetes/#_1","title":"Kubernetes","text":""},{"location":"devops/public-clouds/gcloud/","title":"gcloud","text":""},{"location":"devops/public-clouds/gcloud/#install","title":"Install","text":"<ul> <li>Download zip</li> <li>Unzip and move to folder</li> <li>Add bin to PATH</li> </ul>"},{"location":"devops/public-clouds/gcloud/#debian-ubuntu","title":"Debian / Ubuntu","text":"<pre><code>echo \"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list\ncurl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg add -\nsudo apt-get update &amp;&amp;
